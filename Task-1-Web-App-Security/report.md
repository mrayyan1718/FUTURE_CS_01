Task 1 - Web Application Security Testing Report

 Objective

To perform security testing on a vulnerable web application (OWASP Juice Shop) and identify common web application vulnerabilities. This simulation reflects how real-world ethical hackers assess applications for exploitable issues like SQL injection, XSS, and authentication flaws.

---

 Tools Used

- Burp Suite Community Edition
- Chromium (via Burp)
- OWASP Juice Shop â€“ [https://demo.owasp-juice.shop](https://demo.owasp-juice.shop)

---

  Vulnerabilities Discovered

1. Reflected XSS (Cross-Site Scripting)

- Endpoint:`/#/search?q=`
- Payload Used: `<script>alert(1)</script>`
- Description: The application reflects unsanitized input back to the user without encoding, leading to script execution in the browser.
- Impact: Attacker can steal session tokens or redirect users.
- Severity: Medium
- Mitigation: Implement input sanitization and output encoding.

---

2. SQL Injection (Login Bypass)

- Endpoint: `/rest/user/login`
- Payload Used: `' OR '1'='1`
- Description: Bypasses authentication logic by injecting always-true condition.
- Impact: Unauthorized access to user accounts or admin panel.
- Severity: High
- Mitigation: Use prepared statements and parameterized queries.

---

3. Insecure Authentication Tokens

- Observation: JWT token in login response is predictable and easily reusable.
- Impact: Session hijacking is possible if token is intercepted.
- Severity: Medium
- Mitigation: Secure token generation, HTTPS-only cookies, short token lifespan.

 Screenshots Included

- Proxy tab: Captured login/search request  
- Repeater tab: Modified requests sent and responses observed  
- Decoder tab: Analyzed encoded payloads (Base64, URL)  
- Comparer tab: Difference between success/fail responses  
- Target tab: Application structure analysis  

All screenshots are available in the `/screenshots` directory.

Below is a detailed mapping of vulnerabilities identified in OWASP Juice Shop to the OWASP Top 10:

ðŸ”¹ A01: Broken Access Control
We were able to directly access restricted pages like /#/administration without proper authentication. This confirms missing access control checks on sensitive endpoints.
â†’ Mitigation: Implement role-based access control (RBAC) and validate user roles on the server side.

ðŸ”¹ A02: Cryptographic Failures
The application does not enforce HTTPS everywhere and stores tokens in cookies without Secure or HttpOnly flags. This exposes sensitive data during transmission.
â†’ Mitigation: Enforce HTTPS and secure cookie attributes.

ðŸ”¹ A03: Injection (SQLi)
By injecting special characters like ' OR 1=1-- in the product search bar, we observed abnormal backend behavior, confirming SQL injection.
â†’ Mitigation: Use parameterized queries and ORM tools to sanitize inputs.

ðŸ”¹ A04: Insecure Design
There is no rate-limiting or CAPTCHA on login forms, making it susceptible to brute-force attacks.
â†’ Mitigation: Implement secure design principles such as input validation, rate-limiting, and error handling from the start.

ðŸ”¹ A05: Security Misconfiguration
We found verbose error messages, missing security headers (like X-Frame-Options), and visible stack traces.
â†’ Mitigation: Harden HTTP headers, disable debug in production, and handle errors gracefully.

ðŸ”¹ A06: Vulnerable & Outdated Components
OWASP Juice Shop uses intentionally outdated packages (e.g., AngularJS and Express.js versions).
â†’ Mitigation: Regularly update dependencies and monitor CVEs (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures).

ðŸ”¹ A07: Identification and Authentication Failures
Login forms had no brute-force protection or MFA. Attackers can guess passwords easily.
â†’ Mitigation: Enforce account lockouts, MFA, and strong password policies.

ðŸ”¹ A08: Software and Data Integrity Failures
There is no verification mechanism for packages or scripts loaded externally. Unsigned scripts pose a risk of supply chain attacks.
â†’ Mitigation: Use subresource integrity (SRI), code signing, and secure CI/CD pipelines.

ðŸ”¹ A09: Security Logging and Monitoring Failures
Login failures and suspicious actions are not logged or flagged.
â†’ Mitigation: Implement centralized logging and real-time alerting via SIEM tools.

ðŸ”¹ A10: Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
We simulated SSRF by uploading an image via URL and observed the backend interacting with external/internal URLs.
â†’ Mitigation: Whitelist valid URLs, block internal IP access from user input, and validate user-provided URLs.
